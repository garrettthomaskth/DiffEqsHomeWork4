\section{First Order Roe Scheme with Flat Bottom}
\subsection{Scheme}
We first implement the first order Roe scheme to simulate the shallow water equations for a flat bottom. The algorithm works as follows. We have our equation set up as a conservation law i.e.,
$$q_t+f(q)_x=0$$
so we need a method in conservation form, i.e.
$$Q_i^{n+1} = Q_i^n - \frac{\Delta t}{\Delta x}(F^n_{i+1/2}-F^n_{i-1/2})$$ 
We use the following numerical flux formula
$$F_{i+1/2}=\frac{1}{2}(f(Q_i^n)+f(Q_{i+1}^n))-\frac{1}{2}\sum_{p=1}^2 \lvert \hat{\lambda}_{j+1/2}^p \rvert W_{j+1/2}^p$$
From the previous section, we have 
$$f(q) = \begin{pmatrix}
q_2\\ \frac{q_2^2}{q_1} + \frac{gq_1^2}{2}
\end{pmatrix}$$
From the course text book we have $\hat{\lambda}^1_{j+1/2} = \hat{u}-\hat{c}$ and $\hat{\lambda}^2_{j+1/2} = \hat{u}+\hat{c}$ where $\hat{c}=\sqrt{0.5g(h_{i-1}+h_i)}$,
$$\hat{u}=\frac{\sqrt{h_{i-1}}u_{i-1}+\sqrt{h_i}u_i}{\sqrt{h_{i-1}}+\sqrt{h_i}}$$ 
and letting $\delta = Q_i - Q_{i-1}$ we get $W^1_{i-1/2}=\frac{(\hat{u}+\hat{c})\delta^1 - \delta^2}{2\hat{c}}\begin{pmatrix}
1\\ \hat{u} - \hat{c}
\end{pmatrix}$ and $W^2_{i-1/2}=\frac{-(\hat{u}-\hat{c})\delta^1 + \delta^2}{2\hat{c}}\begin{pmatrix}
1\\ \hat{u} + \hat{c}
\end{pmatrix}$.

\subsection{Single pulse}
We are now going to use this scheme a produce a single pulse, with "wall" boundary condition. We were given the following initial condition for the height :
$$h(x,0) = H + ae^{-(x-L/2)^2/w^2}$$

With $H =1$, $w=0.1L$ and $a=H/5$. The goal is now to find $m(x,0)$ so that we only have one wave traveling. To find this initial condition, let us diagonalize the PDE using the chain rule. Because we have a flat bottom ($B_x=0$), the chain rule gives :
$$q_t+(f(q))_x = q_t + f'(q)q_x = \left(\begin{array}{c}
q_1 \\ 
q_2
\end{array}\right)_t + 
\left(\begin{array}{cc}
0 & 1 \\ 
-\frac{q_2^2}{q_1^2}+gq_1 & 2 \frac{q_2}{q_1}
\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{c}
q_1 \\ 
q_2
\end{array}\right)_x = \left(\begin{array}{c}
0 \\ 
0
\end{array}\right)  $$
