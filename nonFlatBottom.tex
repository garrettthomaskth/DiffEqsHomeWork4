\section{Steady Solutions with Non-Horizontal Bottom}
We now implement the roe solver to approximate the solution of a problem which has a non-horizontal bottom. Having a non-horizontal bottom now introduces a source term, so we must edit our scheme. Our new conservative first order scheme is 
$$Q_i^{n+1} = Q_i^n - \frac{\Delta t}{\Delta x}(F^n_{i+1/2}-F^n_{i-1/2})+\Delta t S(Q^n)$$ 
where 
$$S(Q^n)= \begin{pmatrix}
0 \\ -gh^n B_x(x)
\end{pmatrix}$$
From the problem, we have that
\[ B(x) = \begin{cases} 
      B_0 \cos^2(\frac{\pi(x-L/2)}{2r}) & \abs{x-L/2} < r \\
      0 & \abs{x-L/2} \geq r \\
   \end{cases}
\]
from which we are able to get 
\[ B'(x) = \begin{cases} 
      -\pi B_0 \sin(\frac{\pi(x-L/2)}{r}) & \abs{x-L/2} < r \\
      0 & \abs{x-L/2} \geq r \\
   \end{cases}
\]
